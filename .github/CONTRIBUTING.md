Info for people that want to contribute assets.

<br/>

## Structure

All assets go into the `/Assets/` subdirectory.

Inside assets are structured on a 'project' based  
approach that is easiest to add to and maintain  
but not necessarily browse through.

*This is because there isn't a single approach to*  
*structuring files that covers all ways people want*  
*browse them.*

*Instead this will be solved by to-be-done search*  
*page that will give people an interface to look*  
*for names of files, types of media, ..*

## Placement

If you don't already know where to put your assets,  
it's recommended to open an [Issue] to discuss that.

You can also ask to have your assets  
integrated by one of the curators.

<br/>

## Formats

Wherever possible provide the assets in the  
source format so we can keep data loss low.

For example an icon designed in InkScape  
should be uploaded as an SVG file not as a  
rendered image in JPEG or other the like.

For general images, WEBP is recommended  
as it's lossless by default and saves on space.

<br/>

## Naming

File & folder names should be kept simple.

Use title-case and hyphens to separate words.

### Examples

```
Assets
└─ Splash-Screens
   └─ English-Church
      ├─ Model.FCStd
      └─ Renders
         ├─ Narrow.webp
         ├─ Inset.webp
         └─ Wide.webp
```
